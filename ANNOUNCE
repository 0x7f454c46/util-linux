[Please note that the latest fdisk is "v2.0a (>2GB)" and the latest cfdisk
is "0.8a BETA (>2GB)".  The cannonical versions of both are in this
package, and both should work with disks > 2GB if you have Linux 1.1.46 or
above.]

    WARNING: DO *NOT* INSTALL WITHOUT THINKING.

    This is a collection of many assorted utilities for Linux.  Some are
    system utilities that are not easily available anywhere elsewhere
    (e.g., mkfs.minix, mkswap); others are BSD ports of common utilities
    that are not yet contained in any FSF package (e.g., col); others are
    non-System-V alternatives to common utilities (e.g., simpleinit,
    agetty, login, passwd).

    The arrangement, as nearly as I can determine, conforms to the Linux
    Filesystem Structure, Interim Release 1.1, October 9, 1994, with *NO*
    exceptions.  A copy of the standards document can be found at
    tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/docs/linux-standards/fsstnd/*.

    Many people provided patches and suggestions.  I deeply appreciate
    this.


HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.2:
1) This is primarily a quick bug-fix release for version 2.1
2) mkfs wrapper added back in, since e2fsprogs only supplies an fsck wrapper
3) selection removed, since someone appears to be maintaining it now.  See
   sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/linux/kernel/patches/console for recent sources.
   For the time being, I'm keeping a copy in the historic subdirectory of
   util-linux.  A "make install" should work find from within that
   directory.
4) Note that other floppy utilities are available from:
    ftp.imag.fr:pub/Linux/ZLIBC/fdutils/fdutils-4.1.src.tar.gz
    sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Misc/fdutils-4.1.src.tar.gz
    tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/sources/sbin/fdutils-4.1.src.tar.gz


HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.1:

1) Directory structure rearrange, with configuration support for those who
   use shadow passwords and System V init (no support is provided for these
   things, but your utilities won't get overwritten if you do a "make
   install" after you properly edit MCONFIG).
2) fdisk and cfdisk should work as expected with 2GB+ disk drives
3) As usual, lots of stuff was updated and added, including mount, vipw,
   readprofile
4) Some stuff was also deleted, and can now be found elsewhere:
    fsck wrapper: tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/ext2fs/e2fsprogs*
