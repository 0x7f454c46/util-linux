NOTE: Before installing util-linux. READ the README or risk nuking
your system.  Thank you.

    Util-linux is a suite of essential utilities for any Linux system.
It's primary audience is system integrators (like the people at
RedHat) and DIY Linux hackers.  The rest of you will get a digested
version of util-linux installed with no risk to your sanity.

    Version 2.7 of util-linux is mostly a bugfix release.  But several
utilities that appear in other packages have been removed and
hwclock(8) has replaced clock(8) entirely.

    Util-linux is attempting to be portable, but the only platform it
has been tested much on is linux/intel.  There have however been
integrated several patches for Arm, m68k, and Alpha linux versions.
The present version is known to compile on at least Linux 1.2/libc 4
and Linux 2.0/Libc 5 and has also been tested with libc 6 on intel,
alpha and sparc.  People are encouraged to make _nice_ patches to
util-linux and submitting them to util-linux@math.uio.no.  Thank you.

[To be more precise, earlier versions of util-linux did compile on
Linux 1.2/libc 4. The present version contains at least one obstacle:
the routine snprintf() is not available in libc 4.5.26, but it is in 4.6.27.]

Util-Linux 2.7 is imediately available from
  ftp.math.uio.no:/pub/linux, and
  sunsite.uio.no:/pub/unix/linux/packages/util-linux,
and will appear at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Misc, as well as
  tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/packages/utils 
when the people in charge there get time.
