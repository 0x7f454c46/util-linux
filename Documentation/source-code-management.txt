SCM (source code management):

    Primary repository:
	git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git util-linux

    Backup repository:
	git clone git://github.com/karelzak/util-linux.git

Note that GitHub repository may contain temporary development branches too.

The kernel.org repository contains master (current development) and stable/*
(maintenance) branches only. All master or stable/* changes are always pushed
to the both repositories in the same time.

Branches:

    * maintenance (stable) branch
	- created for every <major>.<minor> release
	- branch name: stable/v<major>.<minor>

    * master branch
	- the status of this branch is: "it works for me". It
	  means useful but not well tested patches.
	- it's source for occasional snapshots
	- for long-term development or invasive changes should be
	  an active development forked into a separate branch
	  (topic branches) from the tip of "master".

Tags:

    * A new tag object is created for:
	- every release, tag name: v<version>, see "git tag -l" for
          more information
        - all tags are signed by maintainer's PGP key

    * KNOWN BUGS:
	- don't use tag v2.13.1 (created and published by mistake),
          use v2.13.1-REAL.
