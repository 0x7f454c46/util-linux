util-linux build system
=======================

 - all util-linux specific autoconf macros use UL_ prefix

 - utils in Makedile.am files are enabled/disabled according to BUILD_<NAME>
   conditions (AM_CONDITIONAL), for example:

	if BUILD_HWCLOCK
	...
	endif

 - all BUILD_<NAME> in configure.am are always based on build_<name> variables,
   for example:

	AM_CONDITIONAL([BUILD_HWCLOCK], test "x$build_hwclock" = xyes)

   the $build_<name> should be available in whole configure script

 - AC_ARG_ENABLE() status is always stored in $enable_<name> variable, possible
   setting:

	"check" - util/feature is optional, if any subcomponent (function, lib,
                  ...) is missing a warning is printed and the util/feature is
                  disabled

	"yes"	- util/feature is required, if any subcomponent (function, lib,
                  ...) is missing an error is printed and ./configure aborted

	"no"	- the util/feature is unwanted
