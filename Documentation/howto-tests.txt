 util-linux regression tests
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 It's expected that for each invasive change or important bugfix you will
 include a test to your patch.

 Compile tests & run basic tests:

	$ make check

 Run all tests including tests that require root permissions:

	# cd tests
	# ./run.sh [--verbose] [--memcheck]

 Run subset of tests:

	$ ./run.sh <test_directory-name>

        for example:

              $ ./run.sh blkid
              $ ./run.sh libmount



 *** WARNING for root users ***

 The tests touch your /etc/fstab. Please, be careful and use
 these tests only for development and never on production system.
