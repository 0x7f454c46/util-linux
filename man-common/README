To get the groff version from an asciidoc man page (example for schedutils/ionice.1.adoc): 

asciidoctor -b manpage \
            -a release-version=2.37 \
            -D output_directory \
            ionice.1.adoc

The headers of the asciidoc files already contain relative paths to the files in man-common.

The groff man page libblikid.3 contains the version number of util-linux from which this library available:

.SH AVAILABILITY
libblkid is part of the util-linux package since version 2.15 and is available from
https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.

I've replaced this section with a generic footer for library man pages; if you consider this version number as important, I will replace the footer with the original static AVAILABILITY section.
