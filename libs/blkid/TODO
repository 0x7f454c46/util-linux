 e2fsprogs:

    - add --disable-blkid
    - "#ifdef BUILD_BLKID" for findfs code in tune2fs.c
    - move fsck.c to util-linux-ng

 udev:
    - add --disable-volumeid to udev package
    - test blkid within udev rules


 - add command line interface for blkid_probe_filter_usage():

	# blkid -p -o udev --filter-usage filesystems

        # blkid -p -o udev --filter-usage noraid

   and blkid_probe_filter_types():

       # blkid -p -o udev --filter-type nofat

   note that "--filter-usage" is necessary for compatibility with vol_id where
   we in udev rules use things like "vol_id --skip-raid"

 - (?) we need to ignore cache and config files when the files are writable
   for non-root users and the library is linked with suid programs

 - add -<BE|LE> suffix to test images for native-endian filesystems (e.g. swap)
   and add support for such functionality to tests/ts/blkid/low-probe

 - do we really need to depend on libuuid? Maybe the default should be
   use in-tree code rather and link against libuuid -- especially when we
   need it for uuid_unparse() only.

 - consolidate "getsize" stuff (see getsize.c and lib/blkdev.c)
