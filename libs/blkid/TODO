 TODO
 ----

 - (?) we need to ignore cache and config files when the files are writable
   for non-root users and the library is linked with suid programs

 - add -<BE|LE> suffix to test images for native-endian filesystems (e.g. swap)
   and add support for such functionality to tests/ts/blkid/low-probe

 - do we really need to depend on libuuid? Maybe the default should be
   use in-tree code rather and link against libuuid -- especially when we
   need it for uuid_unparse() only.

 - consolidate "getsize" stuff (see getsize.c and lib/blkdev.c)

 - rebase to the latest util-linux-ng

 - create a new simple API for LABEL/UUID evaluation:

	blkid_eval_label()
	blkid_eval_uuid()
	blkid_eval_spec()	(spec: <NAME>=<value>)

   this API has to follow the EVALUATE= blkid.conf option (see below).

 - create a new config file /etc/blkid.conf; options:

        * EVALUATE=<method>[,<method>]

	  where the method is "udev" and/or "scan". Default: "udev,scan".

	* CACHE_FILE=<path>

	  where the <path> is path to the blkid.tab cache file. Default:
	  /etc/blkid.tab.

	* SEND_UEVENTS=<yes|no>

	  write to /sys/block/..../uevent when we found that /dev/disk-by/*
          links are not valid (when EVALUATE=udev).

 - modify /sbin/blkid code to use blkid_eval_..() API for "-t LABEL|UUID" option.

 Brainstorming
 -------------

 - try to write inotify based blkid-daemon that watch block devices and update
   blkid cache and inform udev (by uevents) when a new LABEL/UUID/FS is
   detected.

   The daemon should be also useful during system start-up for massive parallel
   devices scanning.
