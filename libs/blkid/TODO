 TODO
 ----

 - (?) we need to ignore cache and config files when the files are writable
   for non-root users and the library is linked with suid programs

 - add -<BE|LE> suffix to test images for native-endian filesystems (e.g. swap)
   and add support for such functionality to tests/ts/blkid/low-probe

 - do we really need to depend on libuuid? Maybe the default should be
   use in-tree code rather and link against libuuid -- especially when we
   need it for uuid_unparse() only.

 - consolidate "getsize" stuff (see getsize.c and lib/blkdev.c)

 - rebase to the latest util-linux-ng

 Brainstorming
 -------------

 - try to write inotify based blkid-daemon that watch block devices and update
   blkid cache and inform udev (by uevents) when a new LABEL/UUID/FS is
   detected.

   The daemon should be also useful during system start-up for massive parallel
   devices scanning.
