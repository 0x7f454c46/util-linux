 - add blkid --low-probe

 - add hex-encoding from libudev

 - do we really need to depend on libuuid? Maybe the default should be
   use in-tree code rather and link against libuuid -- especially when we
   need it for uuid_unparse() only.

 - add blkid -o | --format=full|value|udev

 - consolidate "getsize" stuff (see getsize.c and lib/blkdev.c)

 - add a new flag to keep information that FS is ready to share the device with
   any other FS (iso9960, udf, ...)

 - create a new function

	blkid_do_safeprobe()

   that scan for all filesystems and check for collisions (fat vs. swap)


 - rebase to the latest util-linux-ng

 - add regression tests:
	- add to tests/input/blkid/ FS images
	- create ts-blkid-fs to tests FS detection
