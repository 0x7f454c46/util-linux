NEUTRALITY:

      The stuff in util-linux-ng should be rather distribution-neutral.
      No RPMs/DEBs/... are provided - get yours from your distributor.


DEPRECATED:

      The utils marked as deprecated will be removed in a future version of the
      util-linux-ng. Please, prepare your distribution for this change.

      * boot-time stuff

        The stuff in login-utils defines initial boot-time stuff, things that
        are done in different ways by different distributions.  If you install
        it, your machine may not boot anymore, or you may be unable to login.

VERSION SCHEMA:

      Standard releases:

          <major>.<minor>.<maint>

             major = fatal and deep changes
             minor = typical release with new fetures
             maint = maintenance releases; bug fixes only
       
      Development releases:

         <major>.<minor><suffix>

             suffix = "devel" or "rc<N>"


COMPILATION:

      See the INSTALL file for more details.

      Notes:
            * use SUID_CFLAGS when you want to define special compiler options
              for typical suid programs, for example:

                  SUID_CFLAGS="-fpic" ./configure

              Now this feature is supported for chfn, chsh, newgrp, write,
              mount and umount.
