WARNING: THE PROGRAMS IN THIS SUITE DO *NOT* SUPPORT SHADOW PASSWORD FILES!
	 UNLESS YOU USE PAM.

WARNING: THIS COLLECTION CONFLICTS WITH SYSTEM V INITTAB.
         UNLESS YOU CONFIGURE IT NOT TO.

WARNING: USE GNU TAR -- OTHER TARS WILL FAIL SILENTLY!

WARNING: DO *NOT* INSTALL WITHOUT THINKING.

WARNING: The simpleinit and some other programs in this package are
	 *NOT* System V compliant.  These utilities are meant to be
	 used by people who build their own systems.  If you are not
         a wizard, do *NOT* blindly install these utilities: they could
         prevent you from logging into your system.  Have a boot floppy
         ready, especially if you don't know what you are doing.  It's a
	 great way to learn though ;-)


To install from source:

1) Get source distribution (see the .lsm file for locations)
2) Untar util-linux-2.9.tar.gz somewhere
3) cd util-linux-2.9
4) Edit MCONFIG
5) make
6) make install
7) If you want to use simpleinit and agetty, then make softlinks from
   /sbin/init to simpleinit and from /sbin/getty to agetty, but make sure
   that your /etc/inittab is set up right (this is *NOT* the System V
   compatible init!), or you will be hosed.  If you are using the SysV
   init and/or some other getty, they you can keep using those.


If you have compilation problems:

- with -lcrypt: you forgot to edit MCONFIG and write HAVE_LIBCRYPT=no.
- in cfdisk or setterm: you forgot to edit MCONFIG and write HAVE_NCURSES=no
  (or you forgot to write CURSESFLAGS=-I/usr/include/ncurses -DNCH=0)?
- in fdisksunlabel.c: change #if 1 into #if 0 if there is no <scsi/scsi.h>.
- in mount/nfsmount.c: change #if 1 into #if 0 if there is no inet_aton().
- in sys-utils/ipcs.c: change #if 0 into #if 1 if <linux/linkage.h> is needed.
- in sys-utils/cytune.c: change #if 0 into #if 1 if <linux/tqueue.h> is needed.

elsewhere: tell util-linux@math.uio.no about it.


If you have runtime problems:

- with non-ASCII characters: perhaps you forgot to set LC_CTYPE or LC_ALL?
  (For example, in Norway one can say  LC_ALL=no_NO; export LC_ALL  and
   then various utilities will treat Scandinavian non-ASCII letters as
   letters.)

otherwise: tell util-linux@math.uio.no about it.
