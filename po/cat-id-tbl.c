       mount -l                 : idem, including volume labels\n\
So far the informational part. Next the mounting.\n\
The command is `mount [-t fstype] something somewhere'.\n\

Note that one does not really mount a device, one mounts\n\
a filesystem (of the given type) found on the device.\n\
One can also mount an already visible directory tree elsewhere:\n\
       mount --bind olddir newdir\n\
A device can be given by name, say /dev/hda1 or /dev/cdrom,\n\
or by label, using  -L label  or by uuid, using  -U uuid .\n\
